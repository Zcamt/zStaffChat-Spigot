Todo:

Needs testing:
Add check when sending message to a chat if they've turned it off (You shouldn't be able to send a message to a chat you've disabled)
If chat gets disabled, check if they've toggle the chat, shouldn't be able to type in chat you've disabled
Make sure it's not possible to toggle direct messaging for a chat you've disabled


Done:
Fix chat on/off - weird things happening atm - needs testing???? (Doesn't seem to have issues anymore)
